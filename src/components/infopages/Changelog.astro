            <p>
              Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Welcome to my latest
              experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. Ah,
              honey, your first novel. Where were we. That ain't no airplane,
              look.
            </p>
            <p>
              Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Yeah, well, I still don't
              understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Marty,
              you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Lorenzo,
              where're you keys? You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're
              a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a
              slacker too.
            </p>
